It's starting to turn late. You and the HANGMAN have been at this
game for hours. Both of you are getting weary.

"Time for sleep", he says.

He drags you by your rope shackles into your cell. As the pig 
iron door slams shut you realize you haven't eaten. You have to 
get out of here.

Without food or comfort, your sleep is fitful and haunted by bad
dreams. Still, you live another day to face the HANGMAN.
