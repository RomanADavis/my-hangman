The hangman scratches the last letter in. He doesn't seem so much 
angry as puzzled. He looks at you differently, now. You can see 
it in his eyes. Were you innocent, after all?

He doesn't quite say it. He takes a large knife, somehow just 
right in has oversized hands, and rips through your shackles in 
one clean, efficient motion.

"You're free to go," he says.

You breathe a sigh of relief. Crawling to your feet, slowly, 
thoughts go through your mind. Have you really learned that crime 
doesn't pay? If not, prepare yourself for another round against 
the HANGMAN.
