Your brief flirtation with mercy is over. You think to run, but 
those hopes are gone as the hangman wraps his enormous hands 
around your neck. He could just as easily strangle you.

He lifts you up on to the platform and wraps the noose around
your neck. Did you have something to live for, after all? A lover
who will mourn you? Children that will starve without you? A 
quest that needed doing, a rival that needed slaying? No matter 
now.

The trapdoor gives way beneath your feet. The rope rips into the
skin of neck. Your vertebrae are torn, but they aren't quite 
ripped apart with the sudden drop. You kick uselessly in the air 
as you black out.

The last thing you see is the smug grin of the HANGMAN.
