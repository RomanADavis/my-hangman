You, my friend, are about to die. That is, unless you manage to 
win a game against your executioner, the HANGMAN. The game is 
simple. You merely have to guess the hangman's password.

Take heart! He isn't completely merciless. He will tell you the
number of letter in the password. He will also let you guess the
a number of letters that might be in the word. If you guess a
letter that is present in the word, their positions in the word
will be told to you, if you guess wrongly, the hangman will 
merely begin to draw (a crude) image of your imminent demise.
When he is done, your death is certain.

So... what is your guess? (Type 'SAVE' to save.)
